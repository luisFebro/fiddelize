debounce and throttle difference:
A debounce is a cousin of the throttle, and they both improve the performance of web applications. However, they are used in different cases. A debounce is utilized when you only care about the final state. For example, waiting until a user stops typing to fetch typeahead search results. A throttle is best used when you want to handle all intermediate states but at a controlled rate. For example, track the screen width as a user resizes the window and rearrange page content while it changes instead of waiting until the user has finished.
